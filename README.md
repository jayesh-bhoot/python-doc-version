===============

Redirects Python docs to a preset version.

The addon provides the following Python versions as option:
- 2.6
- 2.7

- 3.4

Preferences of the addon lets you select one of the above Python versions. Next time you navigate to a Python doc webpage (presumably through a Google search), you will automatically be redirected to the preset doc version.
